#Title : <br>
Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Plant Leaf Disease Classification using AI and ML
Description:<br>
This project evaluates the performance of various deep learning models (ResNet, CNN, DenseNet, VGG16, VGG19) for plant leaf disease classification. The goal is to compare accuracy, training time, and other evaluation metrics to determine the most effective model for plant disease detection.
